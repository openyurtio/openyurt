To allow the yurt-controller-mamanger to work properly, we need to turn off the default nodelifecycle controller. The nodelifecycle controller can be disabled by restarting the kube-controller-manager with a proper --controllers option. Assume that the original option looks like --controllers=*,bootstrapsigner,tokencleaner, to disable the nodelifecycle controller, we change the option to --controllers=*,bootstrapsigner,tokencleaner,-nodelifecycle.

If the kube-controller-manager is deployed as a static pod on the master node, and you have the permission to log in to the master node, then above operations can be done by revising the file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml. After revision, the kube-controller-manager will be restarted automatically.
